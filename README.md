# Credit-Risk-Analysis

As part of an interview, I got a chance to play around with this project.
I was tasked with building a credit risk scoring model for Company ABC one that is a credit lending facility.
Even though the data was small, in four days or less I was able to gain a huge exerience in machine learning application in the minimization of credit risk in financial facilities.
I hope this notebook blazes the way for anyone else looking into having an experience of machine learning application in credit risk analysis.
Both the notebook used in the analysis & model building and the data set used in training the models are attached in the resources folder!
